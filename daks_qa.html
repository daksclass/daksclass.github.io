			<h2> Wednesday/Thursday</h2>
			<p>Q: What was your favorite moment in life?
			<p>A: Hard to say. I think I end up remembering little happy moments the best, camping with friends, finishing long runs, fun family games and dinners.
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: Why did you have a buzzcut?
			<p>A: I thought I could pull it off. Haha. And I always wanted to know what it felt like. Plus, I was broke, and travelling, so it was nice an low maintenance.
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: How was Java coded?
			<p>A: Hard to say in a simple condensed way. If you're interested, I'd redirect you to the  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" >wikipedia.</a>
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: What if we don't finish?
			<p>A: No biggie. It's more important to me that you learn stuff. You can always keep working on it!
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: When does gameplan expire?
			<p>A: I'll double check. It might be 6 months.
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: How to practice Java after camp?
			<p>A: Make more games! Play! Get an internship! Make Minecraft mods! Teach a frieds! (Come work at iD tech :P)
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: How do I make my game as great as possible?
			<p>A: Make sure it's foolproof. Be creative. Be silly!
				<br><br><br>
				<p>Q: How do I do collision detection on so many objects?
				<p>A: We'll add a collision method to the objects, then call it in a for loop. I'll show ya.
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: How do I add music?
			<p>A:
			<code style="display:block;white-space:pre-wrap">

import ddf.minim.*;

AudioPlayer player;
Minim minim;//audio context

void setup()
{
  minim = new Minim(this);
  player = minim.loadFile("file.mp3", 2048);
  player.play();
}

void draw()
{
}

void stop()
{
  player.close();
  minim.stop();
  super.stop();
}

			<h2> Tuesday</h2>
			<p>Q:How to do colors with Processing?
			<p>A:<a href = "https://processing.org/tutorials/color/">Look here!</a>
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q:How tall are you?
			<p>A:5'6
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q:What does Dak's hair look like when it's wet?
			<p>A: -_-
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q:How does rotate work?
			<p>A:<a href = "https://processing.org/reference/rotate_.html">Look here!</a>
			<br><br><br>

			<p>Q:How do other languages compare to Java?
			<p>A:I'm gonna break this down.
				<ol><li>Python - has a lot less syntax stuff. Here's what printing looks like in Python: print ("hello world"). Pretty simple, huh? It's generally a bit slower of a programming language. Python is used as a glue language, which people sue to connect a bunch of programming components, while Java is more bottom up.
						<li>C++ - much faster than Java, but C++ code can end up taking up more memory. Here's what printing looks like in C++:   std::cout << "Hello World!";
						<li>HTML - not even remotely similar. Used for website content and structure.
						<li>Javascript - Java is to JavaScript as ham is to a hamster. Java is a general purpose programming language; back in the day, JavaScript was used on websites to make them interactive. It's used for more than that now, but it's still very different.</ol>



			<h2> Monday</h2>
			<p>Q: What concepts are most useful?
			<p>A: Well, all of them :P Haha. But if you get the ideas of variables, conditionals, methods, and loops down, you'll be pretty good to code in almost any programming language.
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: How many places have you been to?
			<p>A: Hard to be sure. I've lived in 5 ish countries. Within the last couple of years I've been to Japan, India, Canada, Czech Republic, Turkey, Azerbaijan, etc.
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: Will you get dunked?
			<p>A: Are you gonna dunk me?
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: Am I your favorite? (I know I am, Gotta be. C'mon)
			<p>A: You're all my favorite! <3 (Also you didn't write your name, so I don't know who you are)
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: How can I use Java to generate pi?
			<p>A: Math.PI gets you 3.141592653589793
