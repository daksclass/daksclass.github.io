			<h2> Monday</h2>
			<p>Q: What concepts are most useful?
			<p>A: Well, all of them :P Haha. But if you get the ideas of variables, conditionals, methods, and loops down, you'll be pretty good to code in almost any programming language.
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: How many places have you been to?
			<p>A: Hard to be sure. I've lived in 5 ish countries. Within the last couple of years I've been to Japan, India, Canada, Czech Republic, Turkey, Azerbaijan, etc.
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: Will you get dunked?
			<p>A: Are you gonna dunk me?
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: Am I your favorite? (I know I am, Gotta be. C'mon)

			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q: How can I use Java to generate pi?
			<p>A: Math.PI gets you 3.141592653589793
			<br><br><br>
			<h2> Tuesday</h2>
			<p>Q:How to do colors with Processing?
			<p>A:<a href = "https://processing.org/tutorials/color/">Look here!</a>
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q:How tall are you?

			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q:What does Dak's hair look like when it's wet?
			<p>A: -_-
			<br><br><br>
			<p>Q:How does rotate work?
			<p>A:<a href = "https://processing.org/reference/rotate_.html">Look here!</a>
			<br><br><br>

			<p>Q:How do other languages compare to Java?
			<p>A:I'm gonna break this down.
				<ol><li>Python - has a lot less syntax stuff. Here's what printing looks like in Python: print ("hello world"). Pretty simple, huh? It's generally a bit slower of a programming language. Python is used as a glue language, which people sue to connect a bunch of programming components, while Java is more bottom up.
						<li>C++ - much faster than Java, but C++ code can end up taking up more memory. Here's what printing looks like in C++:   std::cout << "Hello World!";
						<li>HTML - not even remotely similar. Used for website content and structure.
						<li>Javascript - Java is to JavaScript as ham is to a hamster. Java is a general purpose programming language; back in the day, JavaScript was used on websites to make them interactive. It's used for more than that now, but it's still very different.</ol>
