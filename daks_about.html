						<p>Daks is kind of weird. She lives in Vermont, and is about to finish up college. She has a bunch of sisters and enjoys coffee and loud music.</p>
						<p></p>

						<p>Daks got into programming by accident, but ended up thinking it's
						cool. She has pretty much no idea what she wants to do with her life
						after school, but is considering moving to Boulder and working at a tech
						startup, or becoming a teacher, a traveler, or maybe an astronaut.</p>
